# Danger, Will Robinson! 

This code is still highly experimental!! Contact me at my Github email 
if you're interested in testing it out. This program interfaces with TNC devices
which, when properly configured and connected to radios, will send out AX.25 
packets over the air. There are legal ramifications to this!
