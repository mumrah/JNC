MAP Y2DEF-1 y2def.no-ip.biz UDP 10093 B			;Dynamic address
MAP A1ABC-13 192.168.1.10 UDP 10093 B			;Another BPQ32 Node on my LAN
MAP U3GHI-10 0.0.0.0 TCP-Slave 10095 B			;U3GHI-10 can connect via TCP Port 10095
; U3GHI-10 must have: MAP A1ABC-14 "A1ABC-14's address" TCP-Master 10095 B
; in his configuration file to make the link.  A TCP connection is useful when U3GHI-10
; does not have access to set the local router to allow an incoming UDP connection,
; such as when using WiFi at a restaurant!  It can also be useful when your ISP blocks
; or quickly times out UDP connections beyond your control.  If you are having difficulty
; getting UDP to work reliably you could ask a regularly on BPQ32 node to set you up
; to connect via TCP instead of UDP.  It could solve the problem.  

; You may have as many UDP and TCP mappings as you like..but you will have to
; pre-arrange them with the other party.  As an alternative you could enable AUTOADDMAP
; but this will allow unknown UDP users to connect to you, which could be fine...or not!

; If INP3 routing (experimental at this point) is utilized the 'B' command
; should not be included
; MAP BB9BB-6 example.com UDP 10093

; A keepalive may be needed if you have not properly configured your
; router to direct incoming UDP traffic to the specific machine on you
; LAN which is running BPQ32.  You should properly configure your router
; so that the keepalive is unneeded, as this ploy is not completely
; reliable!

; In the exceptional case where your ISP is dropping your incoming traffic
; testing has found that the keepalive might help 'keep the door open'.
; In the following example a keepalive packet is sent every 30 seconds:
; MAP AA1AA-1 example.net KEEPALIVE 30 UDP 10093 B

; An experimental TCP communication mode was added with the 2009/Aug/28 Beta
; release. The purpose is to circumvent router issues which are almost certain
; when 'your side', which we will call the client side, cannot control access
; to direct incoming UDP packets to your machine.  Instead you will originate
; a connection via TCP. TCP is a connected protocol, all routers should
; automatically set up the return path to your machine.

; An example would be your BPQ32 node, with a node call of MYCALL-5, on a
; laptop at a public access WiFI site. To connect to AA1AA-1 via this method
; you will need this entry in your MAP list (without the ; of course):
; MAP AA1AA-1 example.net TCP-Master 10093 B

; AA1AA-1 is the node call of the remote side, e.g. server side.  The server
; side must have the ability to program its router to direct incoming TCP
; traffic with the specified port number to the machine running BPQ32 Node
; AA1AA-1, just as it does for UDP.

; BPQ32 Node AA1AA-1 at URL=example.net would add the folllowing entry to its
; MAP list:
; MAP MYCALL-5 0.0.0.0 TCP-Slave 10093 B

; As a result AA1AA-1 will listen for TCP packets on port 10093 from MYCALL-5.
; When heard, a TCP connection will result over which AX.25 traffic will flow.
; The server side obtains the client side ip address when the connection
; request is received.

; As currently implemented the client side will have to make advance
; arrangements with the server side so that the correct MAP entries will be in
; effect, as well as to specify a unique TCP port number for each prearranged
; client.

For example you can define the command "BBS". This can either be set up to connect to a BBS running
on your computer, or to be an alias for a command that connects to a BBS on another system.

You can set up a callsign that if connected to will select the command, and if required cause the
call to be added to your NODES list.

The format is:

APPLICATION n,CMD,New Command,Call,Alias,Quality

n Application Number. You can define up to 32.
CMD The command the user types
New Command (optional) The Node command to be run
Call (optional) The call which directly invokes CMD
Alias and Quality (optional) If specified, causes an entry for Call and Alias to be added to your
NODES table with the specified Quality.

Associated with each Application number is an application mask. 

  Appl: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, etc
  Decimal Mask: 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128, etc
  Hexadecimal Mask: 0x1,0x2,0x4,0x8,0x10,0x20,0x40,0x80, etc

; The following configuration is to interface with AR-Cluster running on this machine.  
; Corresponding configuration must be done in the ServerIoCfg window of AR-Cluster.

;AGW Emulator Parameters:
AGWPORT=8001
AGWSESSIONS=6
AGWMASK=2

; APPLICATIONS

; The interface to the A1ABC CC-Cluster no longer requires AGW2CCC.exe to connect BPQ32 to Winsock.exe.
; Instead the BPQ32 Telnet Server, defined previously as Port 4, connects directly to Winsock.  With
; Winsock's AGW port defined as 9002, the statement CMDPORT=9002 in the BPQ32 Telnet Server permits
; the needed TCP link between BPQ32 and Winsock.
; When calling this application the command "C 4 HOST 0 K" is invoked. "4" because port 4 is the
; telnet port. "0" because CMDPORT=9002 is the first instance of CMDPORT in the definition of port 4.
; A second instances of CMDPORT in the port 4 definition would translate to "1".  The "K" establishes
; a keep alive function, whose value is equal to IDLETIME less 60 seconds, to prevent an idle disconnect
; at IDLETIME seconds.
; The following line will create a entry in the nodes table of ABCDXC:A1ABC with a quality 1 less than
; ABCNOD:A1ABC-14.
; You must be running Winsock and CC-Cluster on this machine for the link to be functional
APPLICATION 1,DXC,C 4 HOST 0 K,A1ABC,ABCDXC,255		;A1ABC CC-Cluster on this machine

; AR-Cluster interfaces via TCP Port 8001.  This is made possible by the
; "AGW Emulator Parameters" above. The application number, 2, corresponds to AGWMASK=2
; The following line will create an entry in the nodes table of ABCDXA:A1ABC-1 with a quality 1 less
; than ABCNOD:A1ABC-14
; You must be running AR-Cluster on this machine for the link to be functional.

; The following line will create an entry in the nodes table of 1XCHT:A1ABC-2 with a quality 1 less

; You must execute and properly configure BPQChat.exe for this link to be active.
APPLICATION 3,CHAT,,A1ABC-2,ABCCHT,255				;A1ABC-2 BPQChat on this machine

; The following line will create an entry in the nodes table of ABCBBS:A1ABC-3 with a quality 1 less

; The following is an example of allowing your node to provide a service hosted on another node.
; Connecting to A1ABC-4, or alias 1ABDXA, or entering the command RMTDXA when connected to this
; node, will cause the command "C Y2DEF-6" to be executed.  Y2DEF-6 is a local AR-Cluster
; on the DEFNOD:Y2DEF-1 node.
; The line will create an entry in the nodes table of 1ABDXA:A1ABC-4 with a quality 1 less
; than ABCNOD:A1ABC-14
APPLICATION 5,RMTDXA,C Y2DEF-6,A1ABC-4,1ABDXA,255	;The Y2DEF-6 AR-Cluster is remote

; The same format could be used to offer a local user a connection to a predefined remote CHAT
; or BBS session on a remote node, freeing the node from having to offer those services locally.
